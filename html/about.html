    <div>   
    <p> Thank you for visiting my website! My name is Isaiah Lors and I am aspiring software engineer from Brooklyn, New York. I am 25 years old and very optimistic about the future I have ahead of me. I'm an avid sports fan but primarily focus on Basketball and Boxing. </p>

    Growing up I always had an interest in tech. I wondered how my video games, web applications cellphones worked behind the scenes. It is approaching 5 months since I joined the Pursuit fellowship and the skills I have aquired have allowed me to marry two of my passions to create this project;coding and basketball.

        This is the first of many websites I've created. It contains information about all 30 teams in the largest baskeball association in the world;the NBA. Users can select a team to find out facts about its location and division, as well as search for players and their respective season averages. I'm extremly proud and look to create many more.
